# Group Project Repository

All text and code files related to the group project should be stored inside
this repository.

## Overview

Under the `proposal` directory, please find and use the 
`proposal-template.Rmd` document as a starting point for writing
the project proposal stage.

**Note:** You must _rename_ `proposal-template.Rmd` to 
`proposal-team<XX>-<TeamName>.Rmd`, where `<XX>` is the number assigned to 
your team and `<TeamName>` is the name given to your team.

Make sure to commit your _rendered_ files (e.g.
`proposal-team<XX>-<TeamName>.html` or `proposal-team<XX>-<TeamName>.pdf`)
